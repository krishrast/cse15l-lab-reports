## `cd` Command
![Image](lab11.png)

When using no argument with `cd`, it is as if I have just given the argument `./` which is just the relative path to the current directory. Hence, the directory will not change and behaves as expected.

Here, the argument given to the command was the relative path to the Downloads folder located in the working directory. The argument given was valid and the directory was changed correctly.

The argument given was the relative path to a Java file not a directory so an error message is given stating that the argument was not a directory. This is only an error from the user but the terminal behaves as it should and responds correctly to the incorrect argument.
